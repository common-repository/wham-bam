== Description ==

<strong>Wham Bam is an email subscription widget that grabs attention. It only displays when users are reading your content.</strong>

Wham Bam is smart. It detects when readers stop scrolling and start reading your blog. Our push-down widget shows up just when users are most engaged with your content.

This plugin embeds the third-party Wham Bam service to your WordPress blog (using the standard Javascript embed code). You will need to obtain an API key from [whambam.io](https://whambam.io).
